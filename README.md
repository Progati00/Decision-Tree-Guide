# This repository provides an in-depth exploration of Decision Trees, covering both theory and practical applications in machine learning.
# üìö Theoretical Concepts:
Understanding impurity measures: Gini Impurity vs. Entropy.

Information Gain and its role in tree splitting.

Mathematical explanation of Decision Trees.

Pruning techniques: Pre-Pruning vs. Post-Pruning.

Handling missing values and categorical features.

Advantages, disadvantages, and real-world applications.

# üõ†Ô∏è Practical Implementations (Python):
Training Decision Tree Classifiers & Regressors on datasets.

Feature importance analysis.

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

Cost Complexity Pruning (CCP) to prevent overfitting.

Decision Tree visualization with Graphviz.
